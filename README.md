In the text data, there are reviews taken from Amazon with the reviews being labelled with helpfulness; they are labvelled as "helpful," "unhelpful," or "neutral". Classifying reviews based on their helpfulness, which is a subjective metric, is useful for ecommerce platforms as they can use helpfulness ratings to prioritise meaningful feedback and imrprove user experience. 

It implements a multiclass classification model to predict the helpfulness ratings of reviews as "helpful," "unhelpful," or "neutral." This process includes text preprocessing, feature extraction using one-hot encoding, and logistic regression.
